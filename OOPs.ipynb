        "## **Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "OOP is a programming style where we use classes and objects to write code.\n",
        "It helps in organizing programs and makes them easier to reuse and maintain.\n",
        "It works with concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q2. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A class is like a blueprint or template that defines how objects will look and behave.\n",
        "It contains attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q3. What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "It is created from a class and has its own data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Abstraction hides unnecessary details and shows only the important parts.\n",
        "* Encapsulation protects data by keeping it private and using methods to access it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Dunder methods are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores.\n",
        "Examples: `__init__()`, `__str__()`, `__add__()`.\n",
        "They allow us to customize how objects behave.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (child) to take attributes and methods from another class (parent).\n",
        "It helps with code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Polymorphism means the same method name can behave differently depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Encapsulation is done using private variables (like `_balance` or `__balance`)\n",
        "and providing getter/setter methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q9. What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A constructor is the `__init__()` method.\n",
        "It is called automatically when an object is created and initializes object attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class method uses `@classmethod` and takes `cls` as the first argument.\n",
        "* Static method uses `@staticmethod` and takes no class or object reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q11. What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Python does not support method overloading directly,\n",
        "but we can mimic it using default parameters inside a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Method overriding happens when a child class provides a new implementation\n",
        "for a method already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "`@property` lets us access a method like an attribute.\n",
        "It is used to control how values are read or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Polymorphism makes code flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain\n",
        "because one method name can work differently for different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "An abstract class cannot be instantiated and contains abstract methods\n",
        "that must be implemented by child classes.\n",
        "We create it using `ABC` and `@abstractmethod`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Code reusability\n",
        "* Better organization\n",
        "* Easier to maintain\n",
        "* More secure\n",

        "## **Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class variable → shared by all objects\n",
        "* Instance variable → unique for each object\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q19. Explain the purpose of `__str__()` and `__repr__()` in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__str__()` → returns a user-friendly string\n",
        "* `__repr__()` → returns a developer-friendly string\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "`super()` is used in a child class to call methods from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "`__del__()` is a destructor that is automatically called when an object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `@staticmethod`: no reference to class or object.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Polymorphism works when a child class overrides a method of its parent class,\n",
        "and each object calls its own version of the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Method chaining means calling multiple methods in a single line\n",
        "because each method returns `self`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "obj.setName().setAge().setAddress()\n",

        "```\n",
        "obj()\n",
        "```\n",
